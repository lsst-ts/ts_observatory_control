  wavelength:
    description: >-
      Center wavelength value in nm, used for configuring the Tunable Laser
    type: number
  wavelength_width:
    description: >-
      Optional. Defines the width of the wavelength scan range to configure the
      Tunable Laser for the flat-field calibration sequence when using
      monochromatic light.
    type: number
  wavelength_resolution:
    description: >-
      Optional. When using a monochromatic light source, it defines the
      resolution used to sample values within the scan range, which has a width
      defined by `wavelength_width` and is centered around the `wavelength`
      attribute.
    type: number
  led_location:
    description: >-
      Absolute distance to move the horizontal linear stage between LED
      modules, expressed in mm.
    type: number
    default: 174.91

    description: >-
      Absolute distance in nm for the horizontal linear stage to move a lens to
      focus the laser light from the fiber.
    type: number
    default: 15.380
  use_electrometer:
    description: Identifies if the electrometer will be used in the exposure.
    type: boolean
    default: true

      exposure.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  use_fiberspectrograph_blue:
    description: >-
      Identifies if the fiberspectrograph for blue color will be used in the
      exposure.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  electrometer_integration_time:
    description: >-
      Integration time in seconds (166.67e-6 to 200e-3) for each sample.

      The integration time (measurement speed) of the analog to digital (A/D)
      converter, the period of time the input signal is measured (also known as
      aperture). Due to the time it takes to read the buffer and process the
      data, this is not the rate at which samples are taken. This is generally
      specified by the Power Line Cycle (PLC), where 1 PLC for 60Hz is
      16.67msec. Fast integration=0.01PLC; Medium integration=0.1PLC; Normal
      (default) integration = 1PLC; High Accuracy integration=10PLC. Here the
      integration is set in seconds.
    type: number
    default: 0.1
  electrometer_mode:
    description: >-
      Set electrometer to use different modes. The units recorded will be Amps
      for `CURRENT`, Volts for `VOLTAGE`, Coulombs for `CHARGE`, and Ohms for
      `RESISTANCE`.
    type: string
    enum:
      - CURRENT
      - CHARGE
      - VOLTAGE
      - RESISTANCE
    default: CURRENT
  electrometer_range:
    description: >-
      Set measurement range, which effects the accuracy of measurements and the
      max signal that can be measured. The maximum input signal is 105% of the
      measurement range. It will set the value for the current mode selected.
      Auto-range will automatically go to the most sensitive (optimized) range
      to make measurements. It is recommended to use autorange. When the
      measurement range is changed, a zero correction will be performed.

      -1 for automatic range. Volts range from 0 to 210 Volts, Current range
      from 0 to 21e-3 Amps, Resistance from 0 to 100e18 Ohms, Charge from 0 to
      +2.1e-6 Coulombs.
    type: number
    default: -1
