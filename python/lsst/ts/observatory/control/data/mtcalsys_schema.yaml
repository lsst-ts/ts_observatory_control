      Tunable Laser for the flat-field calibration sequence when using
      monochromatic light.
    type: number

  electrometer_integration_time:
    description: >-
      Integration time in seconds (166.67e-6 to 200e-3) for each sample.

      The integration time (measurement speed) of the analog to digital (A/D)
      converter, the period of time the input signal is measured (also known as
      aperture). Due to the time it takes to read the buffer and process the
      data, this is not the rate at which samples are taken. This is generally
      specified by the Power Line Cycle (PLC), where 1 PLC for 60Hz is
      16.67msec. Fast integration=0.01PLC; Medium integration=0.1PLC; Normal
      (default) integration = 1PLC; High Accuracy integration=10PLC. Here the
      integration is set in seconds.
    type: number
    default: 0.1
  electrometer_mode:
    description: >-
      Set electrometer to use different modes. The units recorded will be Amps
      for `CURRENT`, Volts for `VOLTAGE`, Coulombs for `CHARGE`, and Ohms for
      `RESISTANCE`.
    type: string
    enum:
      - CURRENT
      - CHARGE
      - VOLTAGE
      - RESISTANCE
    default: CURRENT
  electrometer_range:
    description: >-
      Set measurement range, which effects the accuracy of measurements and the
      max signal that can be measured. The maximum input signal is 105% of the
      measurement range. It will set the value for the current mode selected.
      Auto-range will automatically go to the most sensitive (optimized) range
      to make measurements. It is recommended to use autorange. When the
      measurement range is changed, a zero correction will be performed.

      -1 for automatic range. Volts range from 0 to 210 Volts, Current range
      from 0 to 21e-3 Amps, Resistance from 0 to 100e18 Ohms, Charge from 0 to
      +2.1e-6 Coulombs.
