title: Configuration file validation schema of Auxiliary Telescope Calibration System
type: object
properties:
  calib_type:
    description: >-
      Type of flat field calibration. There are two types, `Whitelight` for
      broad spectrum light and `Mono` for monochromatic.
    type: string
    enum:
      - Mono
      - WhiteLight
    default: WhiteLight
  use_camera:
    description: Indicates whether the operation requires a camera.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  atspec_filter:
    description: Name of the filter to select for the spectrograph.
    type: string
    default: SDSSr_65mm
  atspec_grating:
    description: Name of the grating to select for the spectrograph.
    type: string
    default: empty_1
  wavelength:
    description: >-
      Center wavelength value in nm, used for configuring the monochromator
      output.
    type: number
    default: 500.0
  wavelength_width:
    description: >-
      Optional. Defines the width of the wavelength scan range to configure the
      monochromator for the flat-field calibration sequence when using
      monochromatic light.
    type: number
    default: 0.0
  wavelength_resolution:
    description: >-
      Optional. When using a monochromatic light source, it defines the
      resolution used to sample values within the scan range, which has a width
      defined by `wavelength_width` and is centered around the `wavelength`
      attribute.
    type: number
    default: 5.0
  monochromator_grating:
    description: >-
      Select the grating of the monochromator that will be in the path of
      light.
    type:
      - string
      - "null"
    enum:
      - MIRROR
      - RED
      - BLUE
      - null
    default: null
  exit_slit:
    description: >-
      Exit slit width for the monochromator, from 0 to 7 mm (inclusive).
    type: number
    default: 7.0
  entrance_slit:
    description: >-
      Entrance slit width for the monochromator, from 0 to 7mm (inclusive).
    type: number
    default: 7.0
  electrometer_integration_time:
    description: >-
      Integration time in seconds (166.67e-6 to 200e-3) for each sample.

      The integration time (measurement speed) of the analog to digital (A/D)
      converter, the period of time the input signal is measured (also known as
      aperture). Due to the time it takes to read the buffer and process the
      data, this is not the rate at which samples are taken. This is generally
      specified by the Power Line Cycle (PLC), where 1 PLC for 60Hz is
      16.67msec. Fast integration=0.01PLC; Medium integration=0.1PLC; Normal
      (default) integration = 1PLC; High Accuracy integration=10PLC. Here the
      integration is set in seconds.
    type: number
    default: 0.1
  electrometer_mode:
    description: >-
      Set electrometer to use different modes. The units recorded will be Amps
      for `CURRENT`, Volts for `VOLTAGE`, Coulombs for `CHARGE`, and Ohms for
      `RESISTANCE`.
    type: string
    enum:
      - CURRENT
      - CHARGE
      - VOLTAGE
      - RESISTANCE
    default: CURRENT
  electrometer_range:
    description: >-
      Set measurement range, which effects the accuracy of measurements and the
      max signal that can be measured. The maximum input signal is 105% of the
      measurement range. It will set the value for the current mode selected.
      Auto-range will automatically go to the most sensitive (optimized) range
      to make measurements. It is recommended to use autorange. When the
      measurement range is changed, a zero correction will be performed.

      -1 for automatic range. Volts range from 0 to 210 Volts, Current range
      from 0 to 21e-3 Amps, Resistance from 0 to 100e18 Ohms, Charge from 0 to
      +2.1e-6 Coulombs.
    type: number
    default: -1
  use_fiberspectrograph:
    description: >-
      Identifies if the fiberspectrograph will be used in the exposure.
    type: boolean
    default: true
  use_electrometer:
    description: >-
      Identifies if the electrometer will be used in the exposure.
    type: boolean
