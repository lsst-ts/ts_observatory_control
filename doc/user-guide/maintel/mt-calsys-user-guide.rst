Main Telescope Calibration System (MTCalSys)
============================================

.. .. _TunableLaser: https:://ts-mttunablelaser.lsst.io  - not yet active
.. _CBP: http://ts-mtcbp.lsst.io

The Main Telescope calibration system high-level control class is used when working with calibration related CSCs.
This class is not yet developed.

The following MT CSCs are associated with that class, but also controllable individually if required:

TunableLaser
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * The tunable laser is an Ekspla NT-242 pulsed laser which can be used to illuminate the main telescope via either the calibration screen illumination system or the Collimated Beam projector.

`CBP`_ (Collimated Beam Projector)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * The CBP is a calibration device used to project a series of point sources through the optical system and onto the camera focal plane.
