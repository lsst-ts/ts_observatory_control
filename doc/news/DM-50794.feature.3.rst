Refactored ``MTCS.move_rotator`` to make it more resilient.
    
The method will first wait for a heartbeat from the ``MTRotator`` before sending the move command.
Then, after sending the move command, it will wait until the rotator reports as moving.
If the rotator does not start to move it will try again.
If it fails for a second time, then an exception is raised.
