In `maintel/lsstcam.py`:
- Replace a log warning with an exception to prevent filter change if not configured to manage the operation.
- Adds an exception handling for a stop rotator command.
  This ensures that even if the rotator does not respond to the stop command, the `setup_filter` method will log a warning and continue execution.
- Update LSSTCam to add a default ROI spec, which will be used in any take image if the user does not provide an override.
