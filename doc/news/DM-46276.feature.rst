Add features to allow ``MTCalSys`` to better handle the laser
- In ``mtcalsys.py`` made the following changes: 
 - Added ``laser_start_propagate`` and ``laser_stop_propagate()``
 - Added ``get_laser_parameters()``
 - Improved ``setup_laser()`` to change the wavelength and the optical configuration
 - Changed ``change_laser_wavelength()`` so it can be used for the laser or whitelight system 
- In ``mtcalsys.yaml`` added a laser functional setup
- In ``mtcalsys_schema.yaml`` added laser mode and optical configuration
